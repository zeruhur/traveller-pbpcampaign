This asynchronous play-by-post campaign was created to satisfy the curiosity and desire to play Classic Traveller, the rulebook of "science fiction adventures in the far future".

It is due Febraury 2022 and it will have this features:

1. **Fully sandbox open table campaign**
2. **Homebrew setting** (starting from a single subsector)
3. **Use of only 3LBB + Citizen of the Imperium**
4. **Use of Paul Elliott's abstract space combat rules** from Darkest Stars #1

## Asynchronous Play

The game will be played in asynchronous mode: 

* The game will take place on Zotiquest discord server with separate channels for organization, in character play and out of character discussion.

* The game turn is defined by a round of actions of all playing characters and the referee's resolutions. 

* One action per day is required for each player directly involved in the current "scene". The idle is allowed only if the lack of action does not block the game of all players.

* You can play multiple actions per day, in particular interactions between playing characters. The referee will guarantee at least one resolution per day.

## Play-by-post

A play-by-post game by nature is different from the experience of playing at the table. Proactivity from the players is required so that the "shared narrative" is more fluid.

It is preferable to avoid one-liners or repartee that lengthen the game turns and make the exchange boring (i.e. at the store it is better to ask for the list of equipment to be purchased instead of asking for one item at a time by " role-playing")

## A Sandbox Campaign

There is no story, no set event. You will experience the "pure" approach: follow the procedures and roll on the generation tables. The story that will follow will be emergent, based on the actions of the characters.

## Open Table

The game is continuously open to anyone's participation, as well as it is allowed to leave it (even temporarily). It is only required to complete at least the current chain of actions to make the character's exit consistent.

## Homebrew Setting

The campaign will be set in a sector generated with Book 3 rules. The group will start from the capital of the first generated sub-sector. Other sub-sectors will be generated later as needed. 

The lore will be established once the setting is generated but it will be very generic and will allow players to add details based on their character history.

## Only Core Rules

As Chris Kubasik shrewdly analyzed in his "[Traveller Out of the Box](https://talestoastound.wordpress.com/traveller-out-of-the-box/)" series, the 3LBB are a framework and toolbox sufficient to allow years of gaming without relying on anything else.
However, the use of [Supplement 4 - Citizen of the Imperium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/80146/Classic-TravellerCTS04Citizens-of-the-Imperium) will be allowed, for those who want to generate a character with a career different from the six basic ones. Therefore in this campaign the "Other" career will be replaced by the S04 ones.

The most recent version of the rules is available under the name "[Classic Traveller Facsimile Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/355200/Classic-Traveller-Facsimile-Edition)" and includes complete errata. It will be the referee's reference edition. However, if players has the original 3LBB or [The Traveller Book](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/80192/CTTTBThe-Traveller-Book), they can safely use those.

## Abstract Space Combat

The original rules contained in Book 2 are a complex and fascinating set to frame a space miniatures wargame. 

However, they are too detailed and "mechanical" to be used profitably in a PBP campaign. 

In this game you will use the abstract combat rules defined by Paul Elliott and published in the [first issue](https://6318970b-7766-41e3-84fb-a67a824ee35d.usrfiles.com/ugd/631897_22a8370ce39f489fa312576f7c3371c1.pdf) of the Darkest Stars zine, available for free on the [official site](https://www.darkestfanzine.com/).

## Character Generation

The use of the Bat in the Attic career generator is allowed, but it is recommended to set it to "verbose" so that you can follow the evolution of the character and use it to define a background. The background must be only a few lines long.
The format of the character sheet will be the classic one (page 25 of Book 1).

## Game Principles

* **Don't look for conflict at all costs**
  You don't exterminate monsters here, you come out of the adventure in one piece.

* **Combat is war, not a sport**
  The ideal outcome is to survive, not to over-win.

* **Don't let the sheet limit you**
  First comes the fiction, then the mechanics; the "good player" puts his or her mind to work and thinks of clever ways to act on the fiction, not looking at the board to figure out what skill he or she can use to act.

* **Live your past**
  The best fictional lives emerge from the game, not by writing them down.

* **Power is earned, heroism is demonstrated**
  In the beginning, the Characters are nobodies, it's in fiction that you get fame and fortune

* **Analyze the world, test the fiction**
  Have we already said that it is necessary to squeeze your brains?

* **Death is the only end**
  As long as the Character is alive, there is always a way to overcome obstacles. Just analyze, question and experiment.

* **Unleash your creativity**
  Although the setting has a rational basis, you should not limit your possibilities

* **Play to win, enjoy defeat**
  If your character were to die, it's not the end of the world. Enjoy the journey!
